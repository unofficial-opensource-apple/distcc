<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="distcc.html#toc3.1">distcc with ccache</A>
</H2>

<P>distcc works well with the 
<A HREF="http://ccache.samba.org/">ccache</A> tool for
caching compilation results.  The best way to use the two of
them together is to create a masquerade dir for ccache and a
masquerade dir for distcc, and update your path to have the
ccache-in-disguise links be found first, followed by the
distcc-in-disguise links, and finally the real compiler.
For instance:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
PATH="/usr/lib/ccache/bin:/usr/lib/distcc/bin:$PATH"
export PATH
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Another alternative is to munge CC and/or CXX to mention both
commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
CC='ccache distcc'
CXX='ccache distcc g++'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="distcc.html#toc3.2">distcc with autoconf</A>
</H2>

<P>distcc works quite well with autoconf.</P>
<P><CODE>DISTCC_VERBOSE</CODE> can give autoconf trouble because
autoconf tries to parse error messages from the compiler.
If you redirect distcc's diagnostics using
<CODE>DISTCC_LOG</CODE> then it seems to be fine.</P>
<P>Some autoconf-based systems "freeze" the compiler name
used for configure into their Makefiles.  To make them use
distcc, you should either set the PATH to include the distcc
masquerade dir or set <CODE>$CC</CODE> prior to running
<CODE>./configure</CODE>, and/or override <CODE>$CC</CODE> on the
right-hand-side of the Make command line.</P>
<P>Some poorly-written shell scripts may assume that
<CODE>$CC</CODE> is a single word.  Using a masquerade dir
avoids this problem.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="distcc.html#toc3.3">distcc with libtool</A>
</H2>

<P>Some versions of libtool seem not to cope well when CC is
set to more than one word, such as <CODE>"distcc gcc"</CODE>.
Setting <CODE>CC=distcc</CODE>, which is supported in 0.10 and
later, seems to work well.  Using a masquerade dir, which
was first supported in 2.0, is even better (since it avoids
problems with C++ programs too).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4</A> <A HREF="distcc.html#toc3.4">distcc with Gentoo Linux</A>
</H2>

<P>Gentoo is a "ports"-based free software distribution, in
which packages are always built from source on
installation.  distcc works well with Gentoo to speed
installation.</P>
<P>You can install distcc either using the upstream tarball
from <CODE>distcc.samba.org</CODE> (which may be newer), or
using <CODE>emerge distcc</CODE> to get the Gentoo port, which
may be better integrated.  You can also get ccache with
<CODE>emerge ccache</CODE>.</P>
<P>Using distcc (and ccache) to speed your "emerge" commands is
simplicity itself since full support for these packages is
already built into portage.  The two items you need to customize
for your system are the MAKEOPTS value and the DISTCC_HOSTS
value.  You can either set these in the /etc/make.conf file, or
you can export them from your local environment.  Then, simply
/etc/make.conf to add the "distcc" (and "ccache") features to the
"FEATURE" setting (uncommenting the line, if needed), start up
any missing remote distccd servers, and portage will take care
of munging the PATH that the ebuild uses in an appropriate
manner (note that the Gentoo version of distcc comes with a
masquerade dir as a part of the standard installation, and has
had this since distcc-1.1-r8 (when it was first patched into
the ebuild).  For example, if you wanted 9 parallel compiles
and you had 4 remote systems, you might run something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
export MAKEOPTS=-j9
export DISTCC_HOSTS='local larry moe curly shemp'
emerge 
</PRE>
<EM>packagename</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To use distcc for compilations outside of an emerge/ebuild
command, include the /usr/lib/distcc/bin dir early on your
PATH before configuring/compiling the package.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5</A> <A HREF="distcc.html#toc3.5">distcc with gcc dependency computation</A>
</H2>

<P>gcc has the ability to produce information about header
dependencies as a side-effect of preprocessing.  These can
be included in Makefiles in various ways to make sure that
files are up-to-date.</P>
<P>This feature is enabled using <CODE>-MD</CODE>, <CODE>-M</CODE>
and related options.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, gcc changed the behaviour of this feature
between gcc 2.95 and 3.x in such a way that it seems
properly for distcc to generally support it.  The
difficulty is that the filename to which dependencies are
written depends in a very complicated way on the gcc
command line.  distcc needs to change the command line to
run the preprocessor locally and the compiler remotely,
and this can sometimes cause problems.  (This also causes
problems for Makefiles that are supposed to work with both
versions of the compiler.)</P>

<P><CODE>-M</CODE> causes gcc to produce dependency information
instead of compiling.  distcc understands this and passes
the option straight through to gcc.  It should work correctly.</P>

<P>With gcc 2.95, <CODE>-MD</CODE> always writes dependencies
into the preprocessor's working directory.  distcc should
work fine.</P>

<P>With gcc 3.2, <CODE>-MD</CODE> writes the output into either
the source directory or output directory, depending on the
presence of the <CODE>-o</CODE> option.   However, gcc 3.2
also has a <CODE>-MF</CODE> option  that can be used to
explicitly set the dependency output file, and this works
well with distcc.</P>


<P>In summary: for gcc 2.95, no changes are required.  For
gcc 3.2, <CODE>-MF</CODE> should be used to specify the file
to write dependencies to.</P>
