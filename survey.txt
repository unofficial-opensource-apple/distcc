If you find distcc useful, please take a little time to fill out this
survey and mail it to {mbp at samba org}.  

Don't stress too much about getting scientifically rigorous numbers:
rough numbers are more useful than none at all.  Ideally, complete the
survey for one large application that you work on, where compile speed
is important.

0. What version of distcc are you using?

1. Your name and email address:

2. OK to publish this?  Yes/no/yes, but anonymously:

3. Your codebase: lines of code (by wc -l), and language:

4. Your machines: number, OS, processor, memory, network connectivity:

5. Time to compile, with and without distcc:

6. Any other observations:


Thanks!
